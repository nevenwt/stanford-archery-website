Website for Stanford Club Archery

Hi future archery director(s)! The site is built pretty straightforwardly, it just uses a bootstrap theme (credits below). If you have any questions about how the site is built or want any advice about making changes, please contact Neven Wang-Tomic at nevenwt@gmail.com.

Best of luck!
