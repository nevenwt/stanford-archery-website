                    <p> Any Stanford undergraduate, graduate, staff or faculty member is eligible to become a team member once they complete the ten steps of the Recruiting Process. There is no minimum score requirement to remain on the team! The team provides its members beginner and intermediate level equipment free of charge. Team members are also welcome to purchase/use their own equipment if they so choose. The team attends four to five tournaments a year. Members are free to be as competitive as they wish; some plan to hit the bale, others plan to break collegiate records. Team members are required to participate in range maintenance, community programs, and other administrative tasks to retain their good standing and help the team run smoothly.</p>

                    <p>Beginner Practice is a <strong>free</strong> weekly practice offered exclusively to the Stanford community. These practices are tailored for those new to archery, so there's no experience necessary and all equipment is provided! Stanford students (both undergraduate and graduate), faculty, and staff, are eligible to sign up. Please note that we can only accommodate a limited number of archers per Beginner Practice and that spots fill quickly. Priority is given to undergraduate students interested in joining the team. Attending a Beginner Practice is the first step in the Recruiting Process.</p>
                    <p>Beginner Practices are held throughout the school year on Friday afternoons from 3:00pm to 5:00pm on <a href="contact.html">our range</a>.</p>

If we are able to accommodate you the week you sign up, you will receive a confirmation email by Thursday with more details. If there are no more spots available that week, please sign up the following Monday and we'll make extra effort to find space for you. We receive many sign-ups toward the beginning of the quarter, so do not get discouraged if you don't get into the first few!</p>
