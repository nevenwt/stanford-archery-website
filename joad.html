                    <p>JJOAD sessions are held in the Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer quarters in accordance with the Stanford Academic Calendar. During the Fall, Winter, and Spring, JOAD is held on Sundays from <strong>9am to 11am</strong>. During the Summer, JOAD is held on Sundays from <strong>10am to 12pm</strong>. JOAD is held on <a href="contact.html">our range</a> located on campus. Students must be between the ages of <strong>9 and 18</strong> to be allowed to enroll.</p>
                    <p>We will provide all necessary equipment, however students are allowed to bring their own equipment if they would like.</p>
                    <p>Each two-hour JOAD session is $50. If a student is enrolled in the majority of one academic quarter's sessions, each lesson will cost $45. Acceptable forms of payment are cash or check (payable to "Stanford Archery Program"). We ask that parents pay for all sessions that the student is enrolled in for the quarter at their first session.</p>
                    <p>We require that new students take a <a href="documents/safety_lesson.pdf">safety private lesson</a> before their first JOAD session. The student will learn basic archery safety as well as the rules of our range. Read more about private lessons and sign up for one on our <a href="private-lessons.html">private lessons page</a>.
                    <p>JOAD is regulated by USA Archery, a part of Team USA, the same organization that coordinates teams and competitions for the Olympics and Paralympics. If a student enrolls in more than three JOAD sessions per quarter, <strong>they will need to have a USAA membership.</strong></p>

                    <p>We require at least <strong>48 hours</strong> notice via email to cancel a JOAD session. Missing your first scheduled session or two consecutive sessions without notice will result in the forfeit of all remaining sessions for the quarter.</p>
                    <p>If you cancel a JOAD session with due notice, you may switch to another session in the same academic quarter that has not reached maximum enrollment. You may also choose to receive credit for a session in a future academic quarter. JOAD sessions are nonrefundable and nontransferable.</p>
                    <p>Occasionally, inclement weather will force ua JOAD session to be canceled. We will send out an email to our <a href="https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/stanford-archery-public">public mailing list</a> on Saturday evening warning of a <em>possible</em> cancellation.</p>
                    <p>If cancellation is indeed necessary, an email will be sent by 7:30 AM on Sunday notifying community members. Cancelled JOAD sessions are fully refundable, and all students who have paid for the session will automatically receive credit for a future session.</p>

                    <p>Archers who demonstrate superior skill, commitment, and sportsmanship may earn a spot in Stanford Archery's mentorship program, the Junior Team. While all members of the JOAD program will have opportunities to compete in local, state, and national archery competitions, members of the Junior Team will train specifically for these competitions and travel together as a team to tournaments. Junior Team members, furthermore, train and compete with the Stanford Archery Team, and are invited to specific Stanford Archery Team events.</p>
                    <p>We hold tryouts for our Junior Team when vacancy arises. To request an invitation to the next Junior Team tryout, an archer will need to:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Attend at least 10 JOAD sessions</li>
                        <li>Demonstrate a minimum score of 220 (out of 300) on a 40cm target at an 18 meter distance during JOAD scoring sessions.</li>
                        <li>Have attended tournaments in the past year, or have worked out a tournament development schedule with the JOAD Directors and Team Collegiate Director.</li>
                        <li>Be an active member of the Stanford JOAD community and demonstrate outstanding maturity and responsibility, as judged by the JOAD Directors and Head Coach.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Please note that being a member of the Stanford Archery Junior Team has no special weight on the Stanford University admissions process.</strong></p>
